new feature idea, please start by making sure it hasn't already
been [reported or fixed](https://github.com/yamankatby/react-native-material/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aclosed)
. You can search through existing issues and pull requests to see if someone has reported one similar to yours.
