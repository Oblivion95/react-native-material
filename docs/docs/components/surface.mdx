# Surface

Material surfaces can be displayed in different shapes. Shapes direct attention, identify components, communicate state,
and express brand.

<Example component="surface" section="overview"/>

```js
import { Surface } from "@react-native-material/core";

<Surface style={{ width: 120, height: 120, elevation: 2 }} />
<Surface style={{ width: 120, height: 120, elevation: 4 }} />
<Surface style={{ width: 120, height: 120, elevation: 6 }} />
```

Material surfaces have a rectangular shape by default, with 4dp rounded corners. Their shape can be customized by adjusting their:

- Corner angles and curves
- Edge angles and curves

The size of shape changes can be subtle or more significant.
