## Import

```js
import { Chip } from "@react-native-material/core";
```

## Usage

Chips allow users to enter information, make selections, filter content, or trigger actions. While buttons are expected
to appear consistently and with familiar calls to action, chips should appear dynamically as a group of multiple
interactive elements.
