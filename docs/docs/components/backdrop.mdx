# Backdrop

A backdrop appears behind all other surfaces in an app, displaying contextual and actionable content.

<Example component="backdrop" section="overview"/>

A backdrop is composed of two surfaces: a back layer and a front layer. The back layer displays actions and context,
and these control and inform the front layer's content.
