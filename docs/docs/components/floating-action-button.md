# Floating action button

A floating action button (FAB) represents the primary action of a screen.

```js
import React from "react";
import { FAB } from "@react-native-material/core";

export default function App() {
  return <FAB variant="extended" label="Button"/>;
}
```

A floating action button (FAB) performs the primary, or most common, action on a screen. It appears in front of all
screen content, typically as a circular shape with an icon in its center. FABs come in three types: regular, mini, and
extended.

Only use a FAB if it is the most suitable way to present a screen's primary action.
