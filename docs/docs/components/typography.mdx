# Typography

Use typography to present your design and content as clearly and efficiently as possible.

<Example component="typography" section="overview"/>

Too many type sizes and styles at once can spoil any layout. A [typographic scale](https://material.io/design/typography/the-type-system.html#type-scale) has a limited set of type sizes that work well together along with the layout grid.
